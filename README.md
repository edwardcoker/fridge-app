## Objectives

To work with a team of four developers within a timeframe of three weeks and build a web application to help users reduce food wastage by allowing users input expiry dates of their food items and getting an alert notification before the expiration date of the food item is reached. Web application would be built using ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend. A NoSQL database such as MongoDB would be used as the database.

## Overview

This application was developed using for the frontend ReactJS to take advantage of its useful library in building user interfaces, its component based architecture and robust modular structure. NodeJS with ExpressJS was used for the backend because of its real-time application capabilities with a fast and scalable runtime environment.

As part of the team, i worked on the discovery phase of the projects assisting the team in conceptualising the frontend design, features and functional requirements of th application. I also pair programmed with a team member in design and building the schema for the database using MongoDB and connecting it to the web application.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to input names of food items on the web application So That i can add names of fodd products i want to track.
- As a user, I want to be able to add the expiry dates of the food items So That i can know exactly when the food item would expire
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of food items with their expiry dates So That I have an overwiew of all the food items with their expiry dates.
- As a user, I want to be able to easily remove food items from the lists on the dasboard So That food items i no longer wish to track can be deleted.
- As a user, I want to be alerted one week before the food items added are expired So That I know how long left the food item is suitable for consumption.

## Design

The application has a simple user interface where users can input the names of their food items, select the expiry date and submit. The display of all the food items, expiry dates are displayed on a dashboard below the submit buttom. Users can also remove and add items to the display dashboard.
